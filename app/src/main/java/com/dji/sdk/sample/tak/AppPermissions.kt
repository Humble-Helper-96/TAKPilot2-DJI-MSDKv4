/**
 * What this controller still has to be granted before the application can do its job.
 *
 * ⚠ **A CONTROLLER FLEW A 12.5-HOUR MISSION WITH LOCATION DENIED AND NOBODY KNEW** (operator,
 * 2026-09-14). Android denies silently at setup. The aircraft flew, the video streamed and the
 * markers worked — only the PILOT was missing, published at 0,0 in the "position not known"
 * form for the whole mission. The single sign was a log line nobody was reading. The home card
 * now asks this object and says the answer out loud.
 *
 * ## It asks only for what this device actually needs
 *
 * ⚠ **A PERMISSION THE APPLICATION DOES NOT NEED MUST NOT BE COUNTED**, or the line reads
 * DENIED on a controller where nothing is wrong and a pilot learns to ignore it. Measured on
 * the fleet's Android 11 controllers, 2026-09-14:
 *
 *  - **Storage is NOT needed.** [com.taklite.util.AppLog] and [FlightPathLogger] both write
 *    through MediaStore from API 29; the `File` path is a pre-Q fallback. That controller had
 *    both storage permissions denied and still wrote the whole mission's logs AND its flight
 *    records. So storage is required here ONLY below API 29, where it genuinely gates writing.
 *  - **Notifications** are only a runtime permission from API 33. Below that the foreground
 *    service posts without asking.
 *
 * Both are computed rather than listed, so a newer controller is handled without this file
 * being edited again.
